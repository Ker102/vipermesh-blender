ViperMesh for Blender is a free, open-source **Blender MCP server and addon** that lets a compatible AI
assistant work inside your Blender scene. It is for Blender artists, hobbyists
and game creators who want help making and editing 3D scenes, not another coding
project.

**The goal: faster AI-assisted work, fewer AI tokens and better-checked results.**
Your assistant gets ready-to-use Blender actions instead of having to write new
Python code for many common edits. You keep working in Blender and decide what
you want the assistant to help with.

## Watch The Overview

or [download the MP4](https://ker102.github.io/vipermesh-blender/assets/connector-overview.mp4).
See how your AI client uses ready-made Blender actions, why less generated code
can help, and how to get started. This is a silent illustrated overview, not a
timed benchmark recording. GitHub's README links to the playable video.

## Why ViperMesh for Blender?

| What matters to you | How ViperMesh helps |
| --- | --- |
| Less AI usage | Reusable actions reduce the Blender code the assistant needs to generate for covered tasks. |
| Less waiting | The connection stays open, and related actions can run together instead of repeating setup for each step. |
| Better-checked scenes | Built-in checks help identify floating objects, wrong orientations and clearance problems; the assistant can inspect images and repair mistakes. |
| Easier for your assistant | Discoverable tools and concise guidance explain what actions are available and how to use them. |
| Room for custom work | The assistant can still write Python when your request needs something the ready-made tools do not cover. |

AI tokens are the units of text a model reads and writes. Generating less code
can reduce AI usage, but total tokens, cost and time also depend on your model
and the task. Scene checks help with correctness; they do not guarantee a
beautiful or error-free result.

## One Reference, Two Blender Workflows

</p>

One historical image-reconstruction test using the ViperMesh Blender MCP
harness and available assets. Only the centre heading was relabelled; the
reference and both scene screenshots are unchanged. This is one example,
not a guarantee of every result. The public addon does not bundle private
Studio asset libraries.

## What Can It Help With?

- Build, move, duplicate and arrange objects in a scene.
- Soften edges, adjust materials, set cameras and change lighting.
- Check whether objects sit on their supports or leave enough space.
- Assist with mesh cleanup, retopology, UV preparation, rigging and weights.
- Work with animation settings, prepare exports and inspect results.

For example, you could ask your assistant:

> Move the basket under the right side of the table, without intersecting its legs.

> Soften the sharp edges on this furniture, keeping its overall shape.

> Check this scene for unsupported objects, then show me what needs fixing.

These are examples of requests, not prebuilt scene templates. You do not need
to write Blender Python yourself for the operations the tools cover.

## How Is It Different From The Original BlenderMCP?

ViperMesh builds on the original
[BlenderMCP project by Siddharth Ahuja](https://github.com/ahujasid/mcp-for-blender),
now named MCP for Blender. The main difference is its emphasis on a broad set
of ready-made editing actions, reusable workflows and scene checks, rather than
relying on newly generated Python for common edits.

Both projects can inspect scenes and run custom Python. The original project
also offers asset and generation integrations. ViperMesh's aim is to make
everyday scene operations more token-efficient, faster, simpler for assistants
to use and easier to validate. This is not a claim that it wins every task or
that the public connector includes every feature of ViperMesh Studio.

[Website installation guide](https://ker102.github.io/vipermesh-blender/setup/) · [Harness Library listing](https://kaelux-labs.github.io/harness-library/harnesses/vipermesh-blender/)

## Requirements

- Blender 5.2 for the currently tested release target
- Node.js 20 or newer
- An MCP-compatible client that supports stdio servers

MCP, short for Model Context Protocol, is a connection standard that lets an AI
assistant use tools in another application. You need an AI app that supports
these connections; installing the addon alone does not add an AI model to Blender.

## Install

### 1. Install the Blender addon

Download the versioned addon `.py` or addon `.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Ker102/vipermesh-blender/releases/latest).
In Blender:

1. Open **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
2. Choose **Install from Disk** and select the downloaded Python file.
3. Enable **ViperMesh for Blender**.
4. Open the 3D Viewport sidebar, select **ViperMesh**, and click
   **Start Local Bridge**.

Keep the bridge running for the complete agent session.

### 2. Install the MCP server

**Packaged option:** Download the
[`v1.3.0` MCPB bundle](https://github.com/Ker102/vipermesh-blender/releases/download/v1.3.0/vipermesh-blender-1.3.0.mcpb)
and import it into a client that supports local MCPB extensions. It contains
the Node server and its dependencies, so you do not need to clone or build the
repository. Node.js and the separately enabled Blender addon are still required.

The connector is also listed on
[Smithery](https://smithery.ai/servers/ker102/vipermesh-blender) and in the
[official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=io.github.Ker102/vipermesh-blender).
These listings distribute the local connector, not a hosted Blender service.
See [distribution and bundle setup](docs/mcp-distribution.md) for the checksum,
manual extraction option, and current validation limits.

**Source option:** Until the npm package is published, clone and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ker102/vipermesh-blender.git
cd vipermesh-blender
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3. Connect your AI assistant

When using the MCPB import, the client reads its launch configuration from the
bundle. For the source option, use the built entry point from an absolute path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vipermesh-blender": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "C:/absolute/path/to/vipermesh-blender/dist/public-portable-blender-mcp.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Start this command once through the MCP client. Do not invoke `npm`, `npx`, or
`tsx` again for each Blender operation. See [MCP client setup](docs/client-setup.md)
for Codex, JSON-configured clients, compatibility, and the optional Docker MCP
Toolkit route.

## Technical Details

The sections below are for setting up or developing an AI connection. Blender
users can start with the installation steps and the example requests above.

### Connection Model

```text
MCP-compatible AI assistant
        |
        | stdio, one long-lived process
        v
ViperMesh MCP server
        |
        | serialized loopback connection
        v
ViperMesh Blender addon (127.0.0.1:9876)
        |
        v
Blender scene
```

The MCP server opens no network listener. The Blender addon listens on
loopback by default and reports **Stopped**, **Ready**, **Agent connected**, or
**Error** in the ViperMesh sidebar.

### First Agent Calls

1. Call `bootstrap_vipermesh_session`.
2. Inspect the scene with `call_blender_tool(name="get_scene_info")`.
3. Search task guidance with `search_3d_guidance`.
4. Discover only the relevant capabilities with `list_blender_tools`.
5. Build, inspect and repair, then finalize and save.

The public MCP surface includes:

- `bootstrap_vipermesh_session`
- `check_blender_connection`
- `list_blender_tools`
- `call_blender_tool`
- `call_blender_tool_batch`
- `run_blender_scene_stage`
- `get_blender_agent_context`
- `search_3d_guidance`
- `get_3d_guidance_document`

Read the [complete connector manual](docs/portable-blender-mcp.md) for request
shapes, batching rules, staged workflows, local tool skills, and
troubleshooting. The repository also ships an installable
[`using-vipermesh-blender` agent skill](skills/using-vipermesh-blender/SKILL.md).

## Security

This connector is intended for a trusted local workstation. `execute_code`
can run arbitrary Python in Blender. Only connect trusted MCP clients, keep the
bridge on loopback, and review high-impact or destructive operations.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the trust boundary and private vulnerability
reporting process.

## Public Connector Scope

This repository contains the open-source Blender addon, portable MCP server,
portable public tool skills, and connector tests. It does not include the
ViperMesh application, authentication, billing, private prompts, private RAG
data, cloud model routing, private assets, raw benchmark traces, or private
evaluation datasets. The illustrated comparison is separately provided public
evidence, not a bundled asset library.

The connector does not bundle a commercial 3D generation provider. Neural
generation can be added later through provider-neutral authenticated services
without embedding third-party credentials in Blender.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a paid ViperMesh account?

No. The public addon and local connection are free to use without a ViperMesh
account. Your AI app or model provider may charge separately. The addon does
not include free AI model access.

### Do I need to be a programmer?

You do not need to write Python for the covered Blender edits. The initial
setup still involves installing the addon and connecting a compatible AI app.
Use the MCPB bundle in clients that support it, or build from source using the
provided commands. The separately enabled Blender bridge and client setup mean
this is not a one-click install for every environment.

### Does ViperMesh replace `execute_code`?

No. It reduces unnecessary generated Blender Python by providing structured
operations, but keeps `execute_code` for custom geometry, procedural effects,
unusual node graphs, and uncovered workflows.

### Why must the MCP process stay running?

The process retains a serialized connection to Blender. Relaunching it for
every call adds avoidable startup, transport, and agent-tool overhead.

### Does it require Docker?

No. Local stdio-capable MCP clients launch the Node server directly. Docker MCP
Toolkit is an optional packaging and gateway route, and is not yet a supported
ViperMesh installation path because host-to-Blender loopback connectivity still
requires cross-platform validation.

### Does the public connector require ViperMesh cloud authentication?

No. The public addon and local MCP server work without ViperMesh authentication.
Future hosted models and proprietary orchestration are separate product
capabilities.

### Can it use installed Blender addons?

The connector can inspect installed addons and supports trusted local
automation. Unknown addon operations should be reviewed before being exposed
as callable agent capabilities.
