# Lighting Setup & Configuration Guide

## LIGHT TYPE SELECTION

## STUDIO PREVIEW TOOLING

For asset previews, product shots, or "make this model look good" requests, prefer `setup_studio_scene` before manually placing lights. It builds a reusable key/fill/rim area-light setup, frames the camera, and sets preview render defaults.

Recommended sequence:
1. `setup_studio_scene(target_names, preset: "studio")`
2. `validate_studio_scene(target_names)`
3. If framing is weak, `frame_camera_to_targets(target_names, desired_frame_fill: 0.62)` and validate again.
4. `render_image(output_path)`

`validate_studio_scene` now checks all eight world-space target bounding-box corners in camera space and reports `camera.frame_bounds`. Treat frame fill warnings as real composition problems:
- "too little" means the model is distant or visually weak; call `frame_camera_to_targets` with a higher `desired_frame_fill` before changing the whole lighting rig.
- "too much" or outside-frame warnings mean the model is cropped; call `frame_camera_to_targets` with a lower `desired_frame_fill` or larger `frame_margin`, then validate again.
- For product previews, a fill around 0.35-0.75 usually leaves enough professional breathing room.

Use `add_light` and `set_light_properties` for custom scene lighting after the studio preset is in place or when the user asks for a specific lamp/sun/spot setup.

Use `set_world_environment` for world/background changes after the scene rig is in place:
- `mode: "solid"` for clean studio backgrounds and controlled lighting.
- `mode: "hdri"` when the user provides or downloads an HDRI path and needs image-based environment lighting or rotation.
- `mode: "sky"` for outdoor daylight without downloading an HDRI.

Do not write `execute_code` just to adjust background color, HDRI strength, or environment rotation.

| Type | Behavior | Best For | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|---|
| **POINT** | Emits light in all directions from a point | Lamps, candles, fill lights | `energy`, `shadow_soft_size` |
| **SUN** | Parallel rays, position doesn't matter (only rotation) | Outdoor scenes, directional key light | `energy` (1–5 for EEVEE), `shadow_soft_size` |
| **SPOT** | Cone of light from a point | Stage lighting, focused highlights, dramatic | `energy`, `spot_size` (degrees), `spot_blend` |
| **AREA** | Emits from a rectangular/square surface | Soft studio lighting, product photography | `energy`, `size` (larger = softer shadows) |

## ENERGY SCALE BY ENGINE

Energy values differ dramatically between EEVEE and Cycles:

| Light Type | EEVEE Energy | Cycles Energy | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| POINT | 100–1000 W | 100–1000 W | Similar scale |
| SUN | 1–5 | 1–5 | Low values, very powerful |
| SPOT | 200–1500 W | 200–1500 W | Similar scale |
| AREA | 200–800 W | 200–800 W | Size affects perceived brightness |

**Rule:** Start with these ranges and adjust. If the scene is too dark, multiply energy by 2–3×. If too bright, halve it.

## COLOR TEMPERATURE REFERENCE

Use these RGB values (0–1 range) to simulate real-world color temperatures:

| Temperature | Name | RGB Value | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1800K | Candle | (1.0, 0.58, 0.16) | Warm intimate scenes |
| 2700K | Warm tungsten | (1.0, 0.76, 0.46) | Indoor residential lighting |
| 3500K | Warm white | (1.0, 0.84, 0.66) | Office/commercial lighting |
| 4500K | Neutral | (1.0, 0.92, 0.82) | Neutral fill light |
| 5500K | Daylight | (1.0, 0.96, 0.92) | Outdoor daylight, key light |
| 6500K | Overcast | (0.87, 0.91, 1.0) | Cloudy sky, cool fill |
| 8000K | Blue sky | (0.75, 0.83, 1.0) | Shade/sky fill, cool rim |

## PROFESSIONAL LIGHTING SETUPS

### Three-Point Lighting (Most Common)
- **Key light** (AREA, right side, 45° above): Energy 600–800, warm daylight color, size 2.0
- **Fill light** (AREA, left side, lower): Energy 200–400 (30–50% of key), cool blue tint, size 4.0
- **Rim/back light** (SPOT, behind subject): Energy 400–600, white, creates edge separation

Positioning relative to target at origin:
- Key: (5, -5, 5) — 45° right, 45° above
- Fill: (-4, -3, 2) — opposite side, lower
- Rim: (1, 6, 4) — behind, slightly off-center

### Studio Product Lighting
- 4-light setup: Key (top-right), Fill (top-left), Ground bounce (below), Background (behind)
- All AREA lights with large sizes (5–8m) for extremely soft shadows
- Key energy 600, Fill 250, Bounce 100, Background 200

### Outdoor Sunlight
- SUN light: Energy 3–5, warm color (1.0, 0.95, 0.85), small angle (0.5°) for sharp shadows
- Sky fill: Large AREA light from above, energy 80–100, cool blue (0.3, 0.55, 0.9)

### Dramatic/Cinematic
- Single strong SPOT as key (one side), energy 1000–1200
- Colored rim SPOT from opposite side, energy 600–800, blue tint (0.3, 0.5, 1.0)
- Minimal or no fill light for high contrast

## SHADOW GUIDELINES

| Parameter | Effect | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| `shadow_soft_size` | Larger = softer/blurrier shadows | 0.5–1.0 for hard, 2.0–4.0 for soft |
| AREA `size` | Larger area = naturally softer shadows | 2.0 sharp, 5.0+ soft studio |
| SUN `angle` | Controls sun shadow softness | 0.5° sharp, 2–5° soft |

## LIGHT-EMITTING OBJECT GEOMETRY — CRITICAL

When creating geometry for objects that emit light (floor lamps, table lamps, candles, lanterns, sconces, chandeliers, torches), you MUST ensure light can actually escape the geometry:

### Open Geometry Rule
- **Lamp shades** created from cones or cylinders MUST have an **open bottom** so the point light inside illuminates downward. A closed cone traps light completely — nothing reaches the scene.
- Use `bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cone_add()` and then **delete the bottom face** (the n-gon cap), or create the shade manually from vertices without a bottom face.
- Alternatively, for simple shades, use a torus or ring shape that is inherently open.

### Emission Material Rule
- The shade/housing material should use **Emission Color + Emission Strength** so the shade itself appears to glow, matching the point light inside:
  ```
  bsdf.inputs['Emission Color'].default_value = (warm_r, warm_g, warm_b, 1.0)
  bsdf.inputs['Emission Strength'].default_value = 2.0–5.0
  ```
- This is especially important for translucent materials (fabric shades, paper lanterns, frosted glass) where real light would shine through.

### Point Light Placement
- Place the POINT light **at the center of the open space**, not inside solid geometry.
- For a floor lamp with a cone shade, place the light at the **bottom opening of the cone**, slightly inside.
- For candles, place the light just above the flame geometry, not inside the wax body.

### Checklist for Light-Emitting Objects
1. ✅ Shade geometry has at least one opening (bottom, top, or sides)
2. ✅ Shade material has Emission Color set to a warm tone
3. ✅ POINT light is placed at the opening, not trapped inside solid mesh
4. ✅ Light energy is high enough to illuminate surrounding objects (500W+ for lamps)
5. ✅ If the shade is translucent (paper, fabric), lower Roughness and add Emission Strength 2–5

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. ❌ Using POINT lights for all lighting — AREA is better for soft, realistic shadows
2. ❌ Setting SUN energy to 100+ — SUN uses much lower values (1–5 for EEVEE)
3. ❌ Forgetting light color — default white (1,1,1) feels flat; warm key + cool fill adds depth
4. ❌ Only using one light — even simple scenes benefit from key + fill at minimum
5. ❌ Not aiming lights at the target — use Track To constraint or calculate rotation toward subject
6. ❌ Creating closed lamp shade geometry (cone/cylinder) around a point light — the light gets trapped and nothing illuminates the scene
7. ❌ Not adding emission material to lamp shades — the shade looks dark even when a light is inside, making it appear non-functional
