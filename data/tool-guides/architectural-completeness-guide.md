# Architectural Completeness & Scene Construction Guide

## CORE PRINCIPLE: COMPONENT COMPLETENESS

Every real-world architectural element is composed of multiple sub-components. When creating any architectural feature, always model ALL sub-components that make it physically complete.

| Element | Required Sub-Components | Often Forgotten |
|---|---|---|
| Window | Boolean opening + frame + **glass pane** + sill | Glass pane, sill |
| Door | Boolean opening + frame + door panel + handle | Handle, threshold |
| Wall | Geometry with **real thickness** (not single plane) | Thickness for EEVEE |
| Staircase | Treads + risers + stringers + railing | Risers, railing |
| Shelf/Counter | Top surface + front face + supporting structure | Side panels |

**Rule:** After creating an opening (window/door), ALWAYS add the fill component (glass pane, door panel). A hole in a wall is not a window — it needs glass.

## ROOM CONSTRUCTION RULES

### Wall Construction
Use `create_room_shell` for interior room blockouts, room anchors, or background architecture before adding furniture, windows, doors, lighting, or camera setup. It creates floor, walls, and optional ceiling with real thickness so the agent does not need generated Python for the common room-shell pattern.

Use `create_wall_opening` for bounded window/door openings after the wall exists. It owns the Boolean cut, cutter cleanup, optional glass/door fill, and simple frame pieces. Choose the existing wall object deliberately, provide the opening center in world coordinates, and use `wall_axis: "auto"` unless the wall normal is known. Afterward, validate fill/frame placement with `validate_object_clearance` before adding materials or furniture around it.

1. **Continuous walls:** Build walls as a single continuous object by extruding the next wall from the corner of the previous one. This prevents texture clipping at corners.
2. **Real thickness:** ALL walls, floors, and ceilings MUST have thickness (use 0.15–0.3m). Single-plane geometry causes severe **light bleed** in EEVEE where outdoor light leaks through edges.
3. **Apply transforms:** Always `bpy.ops.object.transform_apply(scale=True)` after setting scale.

### Wall Thickness Pattern (Blender 5.x)
```python
# CORRECT: Wall with real thickness
wall = create_cube("Wall", 1, (0, 2.5, 1.4), (4, 0.2, 2.8))
# 0.2m thick — prevents EEVEE light bleed

# WRONG: Paper-thin wall (causes light bleed)
wall = create_cube("Wall", 1, (0, 2.5, 1.4), (4, 0.01, 2.8))
```

### Floor as Distinct Surface
The floor MUST have a different material from furniture. In real interiors, floors are:
- Harder, more worn (higher roughness)
- Different color/texture from furniture
- Often darker (absorbs dirt/wear)

## WINDOW CREATION PATTERN

### Step 1: Cut Opening with Boolean
```python
# Create cutter object
cutter = create_cube("Window_Cutter", 1, (-2.0, 0, 1.4), (0.5, 2.0, 1.2))
bool_mod = wall.modifiers.new(name="WindowCut", type='BOOLEAN')
bool_mod.operation = 'DIFFERENCE'
bool_mod.object = cutter
bool_mod.solver = 'EXACT'  # REQUIRED in Blender 5.x
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = wall
bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply(modifier="WindowCut")
bpy.data.objects.remove(cutter)
```

### Step 2: Add Glass Pane (CRITICAL — don't skip!)
```python
# Glass pane fills the window opening
glass = create_cube("Window_Glass", 1, (-2.0, 0, 1.4), (0.02, 1.9, 1.1))

# Then call create_material_preset with preset "glass" and object_name "Window_Glass".
# Follow with inspect_material_node_graph to verify Transmission Weight, IOR, and assignment.
```

**EEVEE Note:** For interior scenes, using a Transparent shader instead of Glass may prevent light bleed artifacts if exact refraction isn't needed.

### Step 3: Add Window Frame (Optional but recommended)
```python
# Simple frame around the opening
frame = create_cube("Window_Frame", 1, (-2.0, 0, 1.4), (0.08, 2.1, 1.3))
# Cut out center to make frame shape
```

## BOOLEAN OPERATION BEST PRACTICES

1. **Use EXACT solver** — the only reliable solver in Blender 5.x (`FAST` is removed)
2. **Watertight meshes only** — cutter and target must be closed manifold meshes
3. **No flipped normals** — check with `bpy.ops.mesh.normals_make_consistent(inside=False)`
4. **Apply transforms first** — `bpy.ops.object.transform_apply(location=False, rotation=True, scale=True)`
5. **Cutter must overlap** — the cutter object must extend slightly beyond both sides of the wall
6. **Clean up cutters** — remove cutter objects after applying the modifier

## SURFACE CATEGORY CHECKLIST

When building any interior scene, ensure each of these surface categories has a DISTINCT material:

| Category | Examples | Material Character |
|---|---|---|
| **Structural surfaces** | Walls, ceiling | High roughness (0.8+), muted colors, no metallic |
| **Walking surfaces** | Floor, stairs | Distinguished from walls — different color AND roughness |
| **Furniture** | Tables, chairs, counters | Wood/upholstery materials, medium roughness |
| **Fixtures/hardware** | Faucets, handles, machines | Metallic = 1.0, low roughness, distinct from all else |
| **Transparent surfaces** | Windows, glass doors | Transmission Weight > 0, IOR set correctly |

**Rule:** No two categories should share the exact same material. If the floor and furniture are both "wood," use different wood tones (light oak floor vs. dark walnut furniture).

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. ❌ Cutting a window hole without adding glass — always add a glass pane after boolean
2. ❌ Paper-thin walls — use 0.15–0.3m thickness to prevent EEVEE light bleed
3. ❌ Same material on floor and furniture — always differentiate functional surfaces
4. ❌ Using `FAST` boolean solver — removed in Blender 5.x, use `EXACT`
5. ❌ Not applying transforms before booleans — causes geometry artifacts
6. ❌ Leaving boolean cutter objects visible — remove them after applying
